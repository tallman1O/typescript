//Type Interfernce - Type Inference is one of TypeScript's most powerful features where the compiler automatically determines (or "infers") types of variables based on how they're used and initialized, without requiring explicit type annotations.

let tech = "Typescript";
let favNum = 42;
let isHard = true;

console.log(tech, favNum, isHard);
console.log(typeof tech, typeof favNum, typeof isHard);
